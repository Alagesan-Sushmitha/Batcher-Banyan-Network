# Batcher-Banyan-Network

Batcher-Banyan networks are a type of multistage interconnection network that is commonly found in multiprocessor interconnections and ATM switches.

A Banyan network could potentially transport data packets from any input to any output, but conflicts at any intermediate state would result in the loss of packets being carried through. To avoid packet loss in the delta network, we sort the data first before delivering it to the banyan(delta) network, which then discovers and routes each packet correctly.
